Thanks to the selfless blood and tears of
@[amccollum](https://github.com/amccollum), Ender has landed at `2.0.0`.
There's a bunch of new features! Aside from a plethora of bug fixes
and improvements â€” here are the major highlights which will hopefully
entice you to begin using Ender in your next project.

 * anything [npm can
   install](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/json.html#dependencies),
Ender can too!
 * The minifier has been upgraded to [Uglify
   2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)
 * Source map support!
 * New `Module` runtime object for a better `require`! This
   supports multi-file modules, internal/relative requires, requiring
submodules, and better CommonJS compatibility. See [when.js
package.json](https://github.com/cujojs/when/blob/master/package.json#L50)
for an example of multi-files. It's pretty cool :)
 * Clearer understanding of your dependencies output from the CLI

If you have any questions, [file an
issue](https://github.com/ender-js/Ender/issues/new) and we'll be
happy to help.

Enjoy!
